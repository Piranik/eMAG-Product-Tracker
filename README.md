# eMAG-Product-Tracker

It scans the price of the product we are interested in and if it drops below the desired price (which we have specified and entered from the keyboard), it will send an alert.
The scanning will be done for a certain time (minutes - hours) that we will specify.

* Scans at intervals of 1 sec
* Will display the name, current price and date / time in the background
